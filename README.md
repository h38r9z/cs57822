Table   1:   Data   for   Question   1.
(a)      Enter   the   data   in   Table   1   into   R   and   list   the   commands   used.       [4   marks]
(b)      Fit   a   linear   regression   model   for   Y.   List   the   R   commands   used   and   give   the   table   of   t-   statistics   obtained.       [4   marks]
(c)   Interpret   the   R2    and   t-statistics   obtained   in   part   (b).       [4   marks]
(d)      List   the   modelling   assumptions   for   the   classical   normal   linear   regression   model.    [5   marks]
(e)    Does   the   regression   model   in   part   (b)   satisfy   these   regression   modelling   assumptions?   Give   reasons   for   your   answer.       [5   marks]
(f)   If   X   = 15, X   = -1 and   X   = 32 use   the   regression   model   obtained   in   part   (b)   to   estimate the corresponding value of Y.   Comment on the results obtained.       [7   marks]
(g)   Using   R   produce   a   95% prediction   interval   for   Y   for   each   of   the   X-values   in   part   (f).   What   is   the   interpretation   of   the   prediction   intervals   in   this   case?       [7   marks]
(h)   Suggest two ways of   improving the above analysis.    代 写Quantitative methods in accounting and finance: coursework assignment with groups exercise 2024/25R

2.       (a)   Collect   at   least   2 years   of   daily   price   data   for   a ﬁnancial   asset   of   your   choice.   Example    data sources include bloomberg, yahoo ﬁnance or cryptocurrency data from the   website   coinmarketcap   .com   Explain   why   the   asset   you   have   chosen   is   interesting   and   give   the    dates for which you have   collected   data.       [2   marks]
(b)   List   the   dates   and   data   series   collected   by   one   of   your   classmates   in   part   (a).    [2   marks]
(c)   List   the   dates   and   data   series   collected   by   another   of   your   classmates   in   part   (a).       [2   marks]
(d)   Explain   some   of   the   reasons   for   diferences   in   the   data   collected   in   parts   (a-c). [5   marks] 
(e)   Calculate   the   log-returns   for   the   data   collected   in   part   (a) and   list   the   R   code   used. [2   marks]
(f)   Calculate   summary   statistics   (minimum, maximum, median, mean, standard   deviation,
skewness and kurtosis) for the log-returns series in part   (e) and   list the   R   code   used.   Present   the   results   in   a   table.    [3   marks]
(g)   Give   a   table   of   summary   statistics   corresponding   to   the   log-returns   for   the   dataset   in   part (b).       [2   marks]
(h)   Give   a   table   of   summary   statistics   corresponding   to   the   log-returns   for   the   dataset   in   part (c).       [2   marks]
(i)   Using   the   steps   outlined   in   Lecture   9 verify   the   stylised   empirical   facts   of ﬁnancial   time series   for   the   data   collected   in   part   (a).        [10   marks]
(j)   Using   the   steps   outlined   in   Lecture   10 ﬁt   an   appropriate   GARCH   model   to   the   log-returns series   in   part   (e).       [6   marks]
(k)   Using   the   R   package   rugarch   what   are   the   two   main   ways   of   modifying   standard   GARCH models.   [No additional R codes or commands are   needed   for   this   question].       [4   marks]
